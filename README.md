# NoneBlock

Skyblock, but with a twist. You start in a void world, with no blocks or items. The only way to start is to enable the bonus chest during world creation.

Some additional details:
- Biomes and structures still generate, but with all of their blocks removed. They generate in the exact same locations as a normal world of the same seed.
- A single layer of barrier blocks is generated at the bottom of the world, making it easier to traverse the world.
- The Nether and End dimensions generate like the Overworld.
- Some additional features have been added to allow you to access mobs, items, and blocks that you can normally access in survival.
- It's recommended to use a client-side mod, such as MiniHud, to see biome boundaries and structure bounding boxes.

I don't consider this pack to be finished, despite the amount of polishing I've done. It should be perfectly playable, but I might continue to work on it in the future.
